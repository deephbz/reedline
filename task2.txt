# Task 2: Refactor Core Editor - Reduce Duplication in Cut/Copy Methods

## Objective
- **Streamline the `Editor` implementation** by eliminating duplicated logic in cut and copy methods.
- **Enhance code maintainability and readability** by consolidating similar functionalities.
- **Ensure existing functionalities remain intact** or are appropriately modified to fit the new design.

## Subtasks

### 1. Identify Duplication in `editor.rs`
- **Review Existing Cut/Copy Methods**
  - Examine methods like `cut_word_right_to_next`, `copy_word_right_to_next`, `cut_word_left`, `copy_word_left`, etc.
- **Map Similar Functionalities**
  - Create a list of methods that perform similar or identical operations with slight variations.

### 2. Analyze Current `EditCommand` Definitions
- **Inspect `EditCommand` Enum**
  - Identify all variants related to cut and copy operations.
  - Determine if certain variants can be generalized or parameterized.

### 3. Consolidate Cut/Copy Operations
- **Create Generic Helper Methods**
  - Develop helper functions that encapsulate the shared logic between different cut/copy methods.
  - Parameters can include direction (`left`, `right`), scope (`word`, `big word`), and destination (`to_next`, etc.).
- **Refactor Existing Methods**
  - Replace the logic in specific cut/copy methods with calls to the new generic helper methods.
  - Ensure that each original method still behaves identically from the caller's perspective.

### 4. Update `EditCommand` Variants
- **Generalize `EditCommand` Enum Variants**
  - Modify existing variants to accept parameters that define their specific behavior.
  - For example, instead of `CutWordRightToNext` and `CutWordLeftToNext`, create a single `CutWord` variant with directional parameters.
- **Ensure Backward Compatibility**
  - Update all instances where `EditCommand` variants are used to accommodate the new generalized variants.

### 5. Refactor Command Execution in `Editor`
- **Modify `run_edit_command` Method**
  - Adjust the match arms to handle the new, consolidated `EditCommand` variants.
  - Ensure that the correct parameters are passed to helper methods based on command variants.
- **Maintain Functionality**
  - Verify that the refactored execution flow performs cut/copy operations as intended without introducing regressions.

### 6. Update Command Parsing and Translation Layers
- **Adjust `command.rs` and Related Files**
  - Ensure that command parsing logic maps user inputs to the updated, generalized `EditCommand` variants.
  - Update translation methods to generate appropriate parameters for the consolidated commands.

### 7. Enhance `EditCommand` Definitions in `enums.rs`
- **Document Parameter Usage**
  - Clearly define how parameters influence the behavior of generalized `EditCommand` variants.
- **Simplify Enum Structure**
  - Reduce the number of enum variants by leveraging parameters to handle variations in command behavior.

### 8. Develop Comprehensive Tests
- **Create or Update Unit Tests**
  - Ensure that all cut/copy functionalities are thoroughly tested with the new implementation.
  - Include tests for edge cases and various parameter combinations.
- **Validate Refactored Methods**
  - Confirm that the behavior of refactored methods matches that of the original implementations.

### 9. Optimize Performance
- **Assess Efficiency of Helper Methods**
  - Ensure that consolidating methods does not introduce performance overhead.
- **Implement Caching or Memoization if Necessary**
  - Optimize frequently called helper methods to enhance performance.

### 10. Update Documentation and Comments
- **Document Refactored Structure**
  - Explain the rationale behind consolidating cut/copy methods and how the new structure operates.
- **Provide Usage Examples**
  - Include examples demonstrating how to use the generalized `EditCommand` variants.

### 11. Refactor and Clean Up Codebase
- **Remove Redundant Code**
  - Delete old, now-unnecessary methods related to cut/copy operations.
- **Ensure Code Consistency**
  - Maintain consistent naming conventions and coding standards throughout the refactored code.

### 12. Review and Finalize Refactoring
- **Conduct Code Reviews**
  - Have peers review the refactored implementation to ensure it meets design goals and maintains functionality.
- **Iterate Based on Feedback**
  - Make necessary adjustments based on feedback to refine the refactoring efforts.
