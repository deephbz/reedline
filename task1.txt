# Task 1: Redesign Vi Edit Mode - Atomic Implementation of Delete/YankInside

## Objective
- **Enhance the Vi edit mode** by redesigning the implementation of `Delete` and `YankInside` commands.
- **Ensure atomicity** in executing these commands to maintain consistency and reliability.
- **Improve code clarity and maintainability** by adopting a cleaner design pattern.

## Subtasks

### 1. Analyze Current Implementation
- **Review `command.rs`**
  - Examine how keyboard inputs are parsed into `Command` enums.
  - Identify how `Delete` and `YankInside` commands are currently handled.
- **Review `enums.rs`**
  - Inspect the `EditCommand` enum definitions for `Delete` and related commands.
- **Review `editor.rs`**
  - Understand how `EditCommand::Delete` and `EditCommand::CutSelection` are executed.
  - Identify dependencies and interactions between methods handling these commands.

### 2. Define Atomicity for Delete/YankInside
- **Specify Atomic Operation Requirements**
  - Ensure that `Delete` and `YankInside` execute as single, indivisible operations.
  - Prevent partial execution that could lead to inconsistent states.
- **Determine State Management Needs**
  - Assess how undo/redo functionality interacts with these commands.
  - Ensure that the entire operation can be reversed or reapplied seamlessly.

### 3. Design Enhanced `EditCommand` Variants
- **Introduce New Enum Variants if Necessary**
  - Create specific variants for atomic `Delete` and `YankInside` operations, e.g., `DeleteAtomic`, `YankInsideAtomic`.
- **Ensure Comprehensive Coverage**
  - Make sure all necessary variations of delete and yank operations are accounted for.

### 4. Update Command Parsing and Translation Layers
- **Modify `parse_command` Function**
  - Adjust the parsing logic to recognize and correctly interpret atomic commands.
- **Enhance `Command::to_reedline` Method**
  - Translate the new atomic `Command` variants into corresponding `ReedlineOption`s.
  - Ensure that the translation maintains atomicity by bundling related `EditCommand`s.

### 5. Implement Atomic Execution in `Editor`
- **Refactor `run_edit_command` Method**
  - Handle the new atomic `EditCommand` variants.
  - Ensure that all related actions are executed within a single, cohesive method call.
- **Manage Undo/Redo Stack Appropriately**
  - Update the `EditStack` to treat atomic commands as single entries.
  - Ensure that undoing an atomic command reverts all associated changes.

### 6. Ensure Consistency and Reliability
- **Centralize State Management**
  - Ensure that selection anchors and cursor positions are consistently managed during atomic operations.
- **Handle Edge Cases**
  - Address scenarios where atomic commands might fail or encounter unexpected states.

### 7. Update Documentation and Comments
- **Document New Design Patterns**
  - Clearly explain the rationale behind making `Delete` and `YankInside` atomic.
- **Provide Usage Examples**
  - Include examples demonstrating the execution and undoing of atomic commands.

### 8. Develop Comprehensive Tests
- **Create Unit Tests for New Commands**
  - Test atomic execution of `Delete` and `YankInside` to ensure they function as intended.
- **Validate Undo/Redo Functionality**
  - Ensure that undoing and redoing atomic commands accurately restores previous states.
- **Test Edge Cases and Error Handling**
  - Verify that the system gracefully handles invalid inputs or unexpected states during atomic operations.

### 9. Refactor and Optimize Codebase
- **Remove Redundant Code**
  - Eliminate any duplicated logic resulting from previous implementations of `Delete` and `YankInside`.
- **Optimize Performance**
  - Ensure that making commands atomic does not introduce performance bottlenecks.

### 10. Review and Finalize Design
- **Conduct Code Reviews**
  - Have peers review the redesigned implementation for adherence to best practices and design principles.
- **Iterate Based on Feedback**
  - Make necessary adjustments based on code review feedback to refine the implementation.
